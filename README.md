Rewatch of Week 2 Recording - slight mistake on first one

I am updating this Repository using Xcode. 

Just to further follow the instruction. While I was able to follow along during the lecture, and I also understood the commands, I have been tight with time. Unfortunetly, the dust has not settled on the loss of family member. 

Additionally, I do have parallels installed on my mac. I'm not trying to be an overachiever, but once in the field it wont always be peaches and cream. '
